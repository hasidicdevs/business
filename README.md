Business forms and legal papers for the org:

## Open Source Business

We practice what we personally term as an **Open Source business**, this means all of our [revenue](https://github.com/hasidicdevs/accounting), all our [code](https://github.com/hasidicdevs/web), all of our [meetings](https://github.com/hasidicdevs/meetings), and [business documentation](README.md) are all open to members of the community. We mainly operate as a business on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KpGXAEnVnv), this gives us access to a few tools internally that help us with organization and structuring. We use "Stages" and "Voice chats" for meetings. We use "Forums" for keeping track of bugs and features. We use "Roles" to keep track of employees. 

This isnt going to work for all companies but if you have the right group you can also work like this. We have a few open positions on our team and would love to have more people join us. You can view openings on our [careers page](https://hasidic.dev/careers) If you would like to work for a company like this you can join our discord channel and get to know us. After that start browsing our legal documents (*you're doing it...*) and start asking questions about how to join this brand new company. You can read more about open source business and how we do it on our [blog](https://hasidic.dev/blog)
